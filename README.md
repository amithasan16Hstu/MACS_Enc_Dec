## 1. Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital world, securing information has become a paramount concern. Cryptographic algorithms underpin much of the trust and safety mechanisms within communication systems, financial transactions, and data storage. While industry standards such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA dominate practical applications, a foundational understanding of cryptographic principles is crucial for students, researchers, and enthusiasts pursuing computer science and cybersecurity.

The PrimeX Cipher is designed as a lightweight, symmetric encryption algorithm that clearly illustrates the interplay of substitution, permutation, and modular arithmetic ‚Äî essential building blocks of many cryptographic systems. By combining these mathematical operations in a simple yet effective manner, PrimeX enables learners to explore how plaintext can be transformed securely into ciphertext and reliably reverted, using keys based on prime numbers and permutations.

This paper elaborates on the motivation behind PrimeX, its step-by-step encryption and decryption processes, the mathematical foundations it employs, and its relevance as an educational tool.

## 2. Background and Motivation

Cryptographic primitives generally rely on two key concepts: **substitution** and **permutation**. Substitution replaces elements of the plaintext with other elements, typically through key-dependent transformations. Permutation rearranges the elements‚Äô order to obscure patterns.

Modern symmetric ciphers apply these steps multiple times, often in rounds, using complex key schedules and mathematical operations. However, such complexity can obscure understanding when introducing cryptography to beginners.

PrimeX embraces simplicity by implementing:

- **A modular arithmetic‚Äìbased substitution** using a prime number to shift numeric representations of characters.  
- **A user-defined permutation** that rearranges blocks of data.  
- **Modular multiplication** to further scramble the data, with all operations reversible through the properties of modular inverses and inverse permutations.

This construction preserves core cryptographic concepts and encourages hands-on experimentation with keys and transformations, reinforcing understanding of how mathematical operations ensure security and reversibility.

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### 3.1 Key Components

The PrimeX Cipher‚Äôs encryption key consists of:

1. **Prime Number (p)**: A user-chosen prime that defines the modulus for arithmetic operations.  
2. **Permutation Array (œÄ)**: A bijective mapping defining how positions of characters in a block are rearranged.

### 3.2 Data Representation

- The plaintext message is first normalized to uppercase alphabetic characters (A‚ÄìZ), each mapped to an integer from 0 to 25 (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).  
- For convenience, the algorithm processes data in fixed-size blocks corresponding to the length of the permutation array.

### 3.3 Encryption Process

For each block of plaintext characters `(x‚ÇÄ, x‚ÇÅ, ..., x‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)`:

#### 3.3.1. **Modular Shift (Substitution)**  
   Add the key `k` to each character value:  
   `s·µ¢ = (x·µ¢ + k) mod 26`  
   where `k` is derived from the prime `p` (e.g., `k = p mod 26`).

#### 3.3.2. **Permutation**  
   Rearrange the shifted values using a permutation œÄ:  
   `s‚Ä≤[œÄ(i)] = s·µ¢`

#### 3.3.3. **Modular Multiplication**  
   Multiply each permuted value by the prime `p`, modulo 26:  
   `c·µ¢ = (s‚Ä≤·µ¢ √ó p) mod 26`  

The ciphertext block is `(c‚ÇÄ, c‚ÇÅ, ..., c‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)`.

<p align="center"><i>Figure 3.1: PrimeX Cipher ‚Äì Encryption Flowchart</i></p>


### 3.4 Decryption Process

To recover plaintext, reverse each encryption step:

#### 3.4.1 Modular Multiplication Inverse
Compute the modular inverse of `p`, denoted as `p‚Åª¬π`, such that:  
`p √ó p‚Åª¬π ‚â° 1 mod 26`  
Then compute:  
`s'_i = (c_i √ó p‚Åª¬π) mod 26`

#### 3.4.2 Inverse Permutation
Rearrange the values `s'_i` according to the inverse permutation `œÄ‚Åª¬π`:  
`s_i = s'_{œÄ‚Åª¬π(i)}`

#### 3.4.3 Modular Subtraction
Subtract the key `k` from each `s_i`, modulo 26, to recover the original numeric values:  
`x_i = (s_i - k) mod 26`  
Finally, convert each `x_i` back to its corresponding alphabet letter to obtain the original plaintext.

## 4. Mathematical Foundations

### 4.1 Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic forms the backbone of substitution and multiplication steps, ensuring all operations remain within a finite field defined by modulus 26 (alphabet size). This wrapping behavior prevents overflow and maintains reversibility.

### 4.2 Modular Inverse

The modular inverse `p‚Åª¬π` is essential for decrypting the modular multiplication step. It exists only if `p` and the modulus are coprime ‚Äî which is guaranteed when `p` is a prime number and shares no common factors with 26.

The **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** efficiently computes `p‚Åª¬π`.

---

### 4.3 Permutations and Their Inverses

The permutation array `œÄ` is a bijection from `{0, ..., n‚àí1}` onto itself, ensuring each index in the block is uniquely mapped.

The inverse permutation `œÄ‚Åª¬π` satisfies:  
`œÄ‚Åª¬π(œÄ(i)) = i`  
This allows for exact reversal of the rearranged positions during decryption.

---

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Key Generation

1. User inputs a prime number `p` such that `gcd(p, 26) = 1`.  
2. User defines or is provided a permutation array `œÄ` of length `n`.  
3. Compute `k = p mod 26` to use in the modular shift during encryption.
### 5.2 Encryption Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```python
function encrypt(plaintext, p, permutation):
    k = p mod 26
    block_size = length(permutation)
    ciphertext = ""

    for each block in plaintext of size block_size:
        x = map letters to numbers (0‚Äì25)
        s = [(x[i] + k) mod 26 for i in range(block_size)]
        s_perm = [0] * block_size
        for i in range(block_size):
            s_perm[permutation[i]] = s[i]
        c = [(s_perm[i] * p) mod 26 for i in range(block_size)]
        ciphertext += map numbers to letters(c)
    return ciphertext
```

---

### 5.3 Decryption Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```python
function decrypt(ciphertext, p, permutation):
    k = p mod 26
    block_size = length(permutation)
    p_inv = modular_inverse(p, 26)
    inv_permutation = inverse_of(permutation)
    plaintext = ""

    for each block in ciphertext of size block_size:
        c = map letters to numbers (0‚Äì25)
        s_perm = [(c[i] * p_inv) mod 26 for i in range(block_size)]
        s = [0] * block_size
        for i in range(block_size):
            s[i] = s_perm[inv_permutation[i]]
        x = [(s[i] - k) mod 26 for i in range(block_size)]
        plaintext += map numbers to letters(x)
    return plaintext
```

---

## 6. Example

Consider:
- **p = 5** (a prime)
- Permutation **œÄ = [2, 0, 1]** for block size 3
- Plaintext block: "CAT"

**Mapping letters to numbers:**
- C = 2
- A = 0
- T = 19

**Step 1: Modular shift**  
k = 5 mod 26 = 5  
s = [(2 + 5), (0 + 5), (19 + 5)] mod 26 = [7, 5, 24]

**Step 2: Permutation**  
s = [7, 5, 24]  
Using œÄ = [2, 0, 1]:  
s' = [s[1], s[2], s[0]] = [5, 24, 7]

**Step 3: Modular multiplication by p = 5**  
c = [(5√ó5), (24√ó5), (7√ó5)] mod 26 = [25, 16, 9]

**Mapping back to letters:**  
25 ‚Üí Z  
16 ‚Üí Q  
9 ‚Üí J  

**Ciphertext block:** "ZQJ"

Decryption reverses these steps to recover "CAT".

## 7. Security Considerations

While PrimeX is not designed for production use or high-security environments, it incorporates core cryptographic transformations:

- **Key Space:** Wide variety of keys based on prime and permutation, though limited by block size and modulus.
- **Confusion and Diffusion:** Achieved through substitution and permutation.
- **Reversibility:** Guaranteed via modular inverses and bijective permutations.
- **Weaknesses:** Small modulus (26) and fixed block size make it vulnerable to frequency and known-plaintext attacks.

PrimeX is best suited as an educational cipher.

## 8. Applications

PrimeX is useful in academic settings for:

- Demonstrating modular arithmetic and inverses.
- Teaching substitution-permutation networks.
- Practicing symmetric encryption principles.
- Developing student coding assignments.
- Comparing with industrial ciphers like AES or DES.

Students can modify keys, permutations, and plaintexts to explore effects on ciphertext.
